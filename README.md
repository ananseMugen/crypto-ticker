**Uses:**
* [Chasing Coins]( https://chasing-coins.com) as the api endpoint 
... Simple, free, and no api key needed for access.
* [ArduinoJSON](https://arduinojson.org/) for parsing crypto data
* [PxMatrix Library](https://github.com/2dom/PxMatrix) for control of the 64x32 LED matrix .

Hardware setup is pretty much the same as in the [Instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/HackerBox-0036-JumboTron/),
minus the controller. I'm using [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B111B7Y/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for the 
power supply, available from everyone's favorite [knock-off Lex Luthor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uxfRDL-JzM).
Text will be red if the hourly price change is negative, and will be green for a positive price change. Will probably make a
3d printed enclosure for it in the future.
